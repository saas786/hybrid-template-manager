# Hybrid\\Template\\Manager

Hybrid Template is a package for registering custom post templates. Technically, it works for any object type (e.g., post, term, user, etc.), but does not add any UI elements of its own.

The major difference between this and the typical WordPress page template system is that the template doesn't have to exist for registration.  It also defaults to supporting all post types instead of just `page`.

## Requirements

* WordPress 4.9+.
* PHP 7.4+ (preferably 8+).
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing PHP dependencies.
